# SQLZOO Solutions
I've completed all the problems on the [SQLZOO Tutoral](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).<br>
This was done for educational purposes and I did it because I couldn't find any solutions on the website, so I thought that it would have helped.<br>
Enjoy!ü´∂üèª

## SELECT basics
1. Modify it to show the population of Germany
```sql
SELECT population
FROM world
WHERE name='Germany'
```

2. Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.
```sql
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark')
```

3. The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.
```sql
SELECT name, area
FROM world
WHERE (area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000)
```

---

## SELECT from WORLD
1. Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.
```sql
SELECT name, continent, population 
FROM world
```

2. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE population>=200000000
```

3. Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.
```sql
SELECT name, (gdp/population)
FROM world
WHERE population>=200000000
```

4. Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.
```sql
SELECT name, (population/1000000)
FROM world
WHERE continent='South America'
```

5. Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy
```sql
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')
```

6. Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'
```sql
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%United%'
```

7. Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.
```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE area>=3000000 OR population>=250000000
```

8. Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.
```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE (area>=3000000 OR population>=250000000) AND NOT (area>=3000000 AND population>=250000000)
```

9. Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000, 2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2)
FROM world
WHERE continent='South America'
```

10. Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.
```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3)
FROM world
WHERE gdp>=1000000000000
```

11. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LENGTH(name)=LENGTH(capital)
```

12. Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name, 1)=LEFT(capital, 1) AND name<>capital
```

13. Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE (name LIKE '%a%') AND (name LIKE '%e%') AND (name LIKE '%i%') AND (name LIKE '%o%') AND (name LIKE '%u%') AND (name NOT LIKE '% %')
```

2. Show who won the 1962 prize for literature.
```sql
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr=1962 AND subject='literature'
```

3. Show the year and subject that won 'Albert Einstein' his prize.
```sql
SELECT yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE winner='Albert Einstein'
```

4. Give the name of the 'peace' winners since the year 2000, including 2000.
```sql
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr>=2000 AND subject='peace'
```

5. Show all details (yr, subject, winner) of the literature prize winners for 1980 to 1989 inclusive.
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject='literature' AND (yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989)
```

6. Show all details of the presidential winners:
-  Theodore Roosevelt
-  Thomas Woodrow Wilson
-  Jimmy Carter
-  Barack Obama
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE winner IN ('Theodore Roosevelt', 'Thomas Woodrow Wilson', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Barack Obama')
```

7. Show the winners with first name John
```sql
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'John%'
```

8. Show the year, subject, and name of physics winners for 1980 together with the chemistry winners for 1984.
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject='physics' AND yr=1980) OR (subject='chemistry' AND yr=1984)
```

9. Show the year, subject, and name of winners for 1980 excluding chemistry and medicine
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner

```

10. Show year, subject, and name of people who won a 'Medicine' prize in an early year (before 1910, not including 1910) together with winners of a 'Literature' prize in a later year (after 2004, including 2004)
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject='medicine' AND yr<1910) OR (subject='literature' AND yr>=2004)
```
(bis) Just to know that exists the 'UNION' command. It's the logical union in Algebra
```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject='medicine' AND yr<1910)
UNION
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject='literature' AND yr>=2004)
